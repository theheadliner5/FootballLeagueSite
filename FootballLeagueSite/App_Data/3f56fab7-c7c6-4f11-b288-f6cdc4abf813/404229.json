I see the dictionary table in database but not find the text value.</p>\r\n<p>2) To customize the render of searching page I should set the titleProperties, bodyProperties and others. For &quot;list of properties&quot; you mean the alias of properties or the id? I try to set alias but I don't see any changes.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks and regards,<br>\r\nGiuseppe</p>\r\n",
