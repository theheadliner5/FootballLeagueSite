    "Html": "Hi Ast35\r<br />\n<br />\nBy default, you shouldn't really need to specify your document type properties in the IndexSet. (e.g. body and summary). To troubleshoot this, I'd recommend removing these two values for now.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've noticed that the &lt;Enabled&gt; element is set to false in your FullTextSearch.config. Can you please ensure this is set to true. Once you've set it to true, FullTextSearch should automatically start to index your nodes as each of them are published. You can also manually re-index the entire site by using the FullTextSearch tab in the Developer section.\r<br />\n<br />\nLastly, I assume your templates do actually have the content available for your body and summary properties. FullTextSearch indexes what is actually rendered on the frontend, so the markup for your content should be included in your page source.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf this doesn't work, I'd suggest reverting to the default values for the following FullTextSearch.config values to further troubleshoot: set &lt;PublishEventRenderings&gt; to false and set &lt;DefaultRenderer&gt; to HTTP. Once updated, please ensure to re-index the site by using the Developer section again.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this helps.\r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards,\r<br />\nRigardt<br />\n",
