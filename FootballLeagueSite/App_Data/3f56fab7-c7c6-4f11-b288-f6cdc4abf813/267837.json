    "Html": "<p>Hi Martin,</p>\r\n<p>The useWildcards setting actually appends a wildcard to the end of a query automatically. So typing pro should automatcically match property and professional. I probably should have made that clearer in the documentation.</p>\r\n<p>If you acually type the wildcard it just gets escaped by the query parser. I can look into adding support for user typed wildcards in a future version.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Bjorn</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi Bjorn,</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the quick reply - you pointed me in the right direction (setting useWildcards=\"1\").</p>\r\n<p>I <em>did </em>try it yesterday, actually, but I thought it was wrong since the search result went a bit crazy at the same time I&nbsp;set useWildcards=\"1\". It seems that on my site as soon as&nbsp;useWildcards is set to \"1\" then a lot of wrong hits appear under the right hits when I search. One thing goes again in all the wrong hits: They link to pages that contain the character \"5\" (the number five). Not every search query gives these wrong hits. It seems that \"5\" must appear in the right hit pages too and then the long list of wrong pages (pages not containing my query word) appear also.</p>\r\n<p>I know it sounds weird, but can it be that there is a bug in the package that gives the character \"5\" a special role?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>BTW: Thanks for the great package - it has made it possible for me to actually set up Examine! :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cheers.</p>\r\n<p>Martin</p>",
