Can someone please tell me how to remove this fullText packge from Umbraco so I can proceed with an upgrade of Umbraco?  Again, this package installed through the Umbraco installer but does not show up in the list of installed packages to be able to uninstall it, nor does it show up in the package manifest within Umbraco.  How do I safely remove it? <br />\n",
