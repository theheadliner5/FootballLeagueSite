Search completed in 0.013 seconds. <br />\n<br />\nNotice that there should be a link for a second page - &quot;2&quot; to show results 21-39.<br />\n<br />\nI was able to fix it on line 191 of 'Search_Results.cshtml' with the following change:<br />\n<pre><code>var numPages = (int)resultsItem.Current.Evaluate(&quot;number(/results/summary/@numPages)&quot;)+1;</code></pre>\n\nbut this seems to be more of a band-aid, since I'd assume that the Evaluate function ought to be returning the correct number of pages.<br />\nHeather<br />\n",
