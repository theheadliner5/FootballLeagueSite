Umbraco Full Text Search

This package makes it easy to index and search the full content of Umbraco pages using the built in Lucene based Examine functionality.

It reads the full HTML of pages after publishing, tag strips them, and adds them to the Lucene index. An editable Razor macro for searching the index with a rich variety of options is provided.
